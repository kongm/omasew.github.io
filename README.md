## Welcome to the OMASE (Optimization, Modeling, Analysis and Space Exploration) Workshop page!!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/omasew/omasew.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Purpose and Scope of OMASE

Current hardware and software trends are proving to be extremely complex and heterogeneous. This poses a serious challenge for developers and scientists when implementing their application code for a wide variety of architectures, network interconnects, deep memory hierarchies, accelerators, stacked run-time layers, among many other features.

This workshop aims to highlight research that automates the derivation of architecture-specific code, thus simplifying the porting, adaptation, and deployment process of applications. Such research encompasses techniques that systematically explore search spaces describing possible optimization strategies to derive the best target implementation. This includes architecture-specific transformations and optimization algorithms, performance and energy modeling, and automatic and hybrid exploration of the search spaces of strategies. 

We are interested in research that spans one or more performance factors such as the synergistic behavior of compile-time and runtime optimizations, application to architecture mapping, and the characterization of input-sensitive programs. The goal of the proposed workshop is to bring together academics, researchers, application scientists and programmers to share their preliminary research in all aspects of tuning and auto-tuning systems.
